        <h1>Project: Skin Cancer Detection</h1>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, with millions of new cases diagnosed each year. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. Advances in machine learning and image processing have opened new avenues for developing automated systems for skin cancer detection. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify skin lesions as benign or malignant based on image data.</p>
        
        <h2>Role and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As a team member in the skin cancer detection project, I collected, filtered, and cleaned datasets from various sources, designed the machine learning model using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, and integrated it into a Flask-based web application.</p>

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>The skin cancer detection project aims to develop a machine learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify and diagnose skin lesions from medical images.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>The project was developed to create a machine learning model for accurate detection and classification of skin cancer from images. We started with data collection and preprocessing, followed by feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. One major challenge was handling the imbalanced dataset, which was addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).</p>
